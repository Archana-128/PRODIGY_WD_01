# Interactive Navigation Menu

This project is a simple, responsive landing page with an interactive navigation menu. The page includes sections for Home, About, Services, and Contact. The navigation menu changes its background color and adds a shadow when the user scrolls down the page. The page also includes Font Awesome icons for visual enhancement.

## Features

1. *Responsive Navigation Bar*:
   - The navigation bar is fixed at the top and stretches the full width of the page.
   - As the user scrolls down, the navigation bar changes its background color and adds a subtle shadow effect to enhance visibility.

2. *Smooth Scrolling Effect*:
   - The page includes links in the navigation bar that scroll smoothly to different sections: Home, About, Services, and Contact.

3. *Font Awesome Icons*:
   - Font Awesome icons are used for the menu items, adding a visual element to each section link.

4. *Section-based Layout*:
   - The page is divided into different sections, each containing a title and description, making it ideal for a landing page.

## Technologies Used

- *HTML5*: The structure of the page.
- *CSS3*: For styling the navigation bar, sections, and hover effects.
- *JavaScript*: For the scroll event listener that changes the navigation bar style on scrolling.
- *Font Awesome*: For adding icons to the menu items.

## Code Overview

### HTML Structure

- The page is structured with a <nav> element containing the navigation menu and several <section> elements for the content.
- The navigation bar includes icons and text links to different sections of the page.

### CSS Styling

- The body uses the Arial, sans-serif font family.
- The navigation bar is styled with a background color (#DEB887), and its color changes when the user scrolls.
- A smooth transition effect is applied to the navigation bar's background color and box-shadow for a more dynamic feel.

### JavaScript Functionality

- The script listens for a scroll event and adds a scrolled class to the navigation bar when the user scrolls past 50 pixels. This class changes the background color and adds a box-shadow.
